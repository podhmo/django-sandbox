django-sandbox
----------------------------------------

A tiny sandbox environemnt for django-begginer.

why django-sandbox?
----------------------------------------

Non-expert django developper doesn't know about django, deeply, so,
she-or-he wonder what the way, checking that is correct or not.

Of cource, normally, following such as below actions

1. Create a project.
2. Edit settings.
3. Add code for something about you want to check for.

this is too tiresome, at least for me.
