django-sandbox
----------------------------------------

A tiny sandbox environment for django-begginer.

why django-sandbox?
----------------------------------------

Non-expert django developper doesn't know about django, deeply, so,
she-or-he wonder what the way, checking that is correct or not.

Of cource, normally, following such as below actions

1. Creating a project.
2. Editting settings.
3. Adding code for something about you want to check for.

this is too tiresome, at least for me.

what are contents of django-sandbox?
----------------------------------------

- about model
- about template
- about form
- about view(including urlmatch)

these sample are only one file (or a few of external files).
